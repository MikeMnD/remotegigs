### 3. How to filter the offers

The filter is set by [criteria.yaml](https://github.com/comrade-coop/remotegigs/blob/master/TOOL/criteria.yaml) in the tool's directory.The filter is separated by two groups: 

Group 1 (all of these) - gives results containing all of the arguments written down 

Group 2 (any of these) - gives results containing any of the arguements written down

The result in the command line tool is the combined one from both groups. You can comment with "#" any of the labels you do not want to use.

*Example:

Group 1 filters by all of these (first AND second AND third ...)

```includesAll: - 'front-end' - 'full-stack'```

Group 2 filters additional by any of these (first OR second OR third..)

```includesAny: - 'front-end' - 'c#'*```
