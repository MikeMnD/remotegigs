[WIP]How to use the filter
The filter is set by criteria.yaml in the directory. It is separated in two groups includesAll and includesAny, as follows the first one will filter by all the criterias, while the second one - by any of them.
Group 1 filters by all of these (first AND second AND third ...)
includesAll: - 'front-end' - 'full-stack'
Group 2 filters additional by any of these (first OR second OR third..)
includesAny: - 'front-end' - 'c#'
